# **Delayed Reward Bernoulli Bandits: Optimal Policy and Predictive Meta-Algorithm PARDI**

## **Official Data Repository**
This the official data repository for the paper "Delayed Reward Bernoulli Bandits: Optimal Policy and Predictive Meta-Algorithm PARDI" by Sebastian Pilarski, Slawomir Pilarski, and Daniel Varro. It contains nearly 1.5-million files with various simulation and computation results. Each file contains values averaged over 1 million simulation runs.

[**Core data**](core_data): 
Core data contains normalized simulation data averaged over 1 million simulations. 

[**Regret as a function of number of arms**](fn_of_arms): 
Provides data for the Whittle index and Whittle index w/ PARDI for various delays for a range of arms.

[**Regret as a function of delay**](fn_of_delay):
